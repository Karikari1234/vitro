# Vitro Overrides

Vitro lets you overrides parts of the vitro ui to let you add more customization

You can create a file called `vitro-overrides.jsx` and export some components to override specific parts of the Vitro UI

These customizations will be applied only to experiments children of the `vitro-overrides.jsx` directory

## Wrapper

You can change the stories wrapper exporting a wrapper component

This will be applied before the wrapper exported from the experiment file

```jsx
// vitro-overrides.jsx
import React from 'react'

export function Wrapper({ children, isisDark, isFullScreen, }) {
    return <div style={{ textAlign: 'center' }}>{children}</div>
}
```

> More overrides are coming! soon you will be able to override the header logo and footer for example

<!-- TODO add logo override -->
