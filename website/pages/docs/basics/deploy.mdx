# Deploy

To deploy your vitro website you can use a website hosting platform like [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

To produce your static assets you can run

```sh
vitro build --out ./dist
```

## Change base path

In case you want to deploy to a sub path like `https://example.com/path` you will need to pass the basePath option in config

```js
// vitro.config.js
module.exports = {
    basePath: '/path',
}
```

> `basePath` will not be used in development!
