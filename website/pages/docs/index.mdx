# Getting Started

## 1. Install the cli

First install the cli with

```sh
npm i -g storyboards
```

## 2. Init the project

Init the project with

```sh
storyboards new
```

The command above creates a `storyboards.config.js` config file and a `.storyboards` directory

You can customize the config changing the stories location and an optional wrapper path that points to a file that has a react component as default export

```js
// storyboards.config.js

module.exports = {
    stories: ['./example-package/.story.tsx'], // glob to your stories
    wrapper: './example-package/src/Wrapper.tsx', // file that has a react component as default export
}
```

## 3. Start the server

Now you can start the server with

```sh
storyboards start -p 6006
```

This will start a web server on [localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) with your stories
