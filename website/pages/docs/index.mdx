# Getting Started

## 1. Install the cli

First install the cli with

```sh
npm i -g @vitro/cli
```

## 2. Init the project

Now go inside your react project directory and create a default config with

```sh
vitro init
```

The command above creates a `vitro.config.js` config file and some example stories

```js
// vitro.config.js
module.exports = {
    globs: ['./**/*.story.tsx'], // glob to your stories
}
```

## 3. Start the server

Now you can start the server with

```sh
vitro dev
```

This will start a web server on [localhost:7007](http://localhost:7007) with your stories
