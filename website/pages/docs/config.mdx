# Config

The configuration used by Vitro must be in a file named `vitro.config.js` with an object as its `module.exports`

This is what the default configuration looks like

```js
module.exports = {
    globs: ['./**/*.vitro.jsx'], // globs to search for experiment files
    ignore: [], // add directories to ignore when searching for experiment files
}
```
